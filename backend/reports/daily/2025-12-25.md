## ✅ Work Done In (2025-12-25)

### User Management API

- Implemented user controllers covering key profile and admin flows:
	- `meController`, `updateMeController`, `updateAvatarMeController`, `updatePasswordMeController`
	- Admin endpoints: `getAllUsersController`, `getUserByIdController`, `updateUserByRoleController`, `deleteUserController`
- Standardized success responses and structured logging across all user controllers.

### Routing & Middleware

- Added protected user routes in `user.route.js` with role-based access for admin operations.
- Integrated `authenticate.middleware` for Bearer auth and roles, `asyncHandler.middleware` for error-safe controllers.
- Wired request validation via `validateRequest.middleware` using user schemas for body/params.
- Enabled avatar upload handling with `uploadFields([{ name: 'avatar', maxCount: 1 }])` (multer) on the `/me/avatar` route.
- Introduced `apiRateLimiter` keyed by `req.user.userId` to throttle authenticated requests consistently.

### Repository Layer

- Added focused user repository helpers:
	- `findUserById`, `findUserByIdAndUpdate` (returns sanitized user without password/refresh),
	- `findAllUsers` (sanitized list), `deleteUserById`.

### Configuration

- Extended environment configuration in `env.config.js` and ensured validation via `env.validator` and utility `validateEnv`.
- Consolidated app/environment variables (JWT, DB, logging, OAuth credentials) in a single config object.

### Error Handling & Logging

- Ensured consistent error propagation with APIError and centralized success responses.
- Added informative logs for CRUD operations and profile actions.

## 📌 Pending / In Progress

- Implement Course Model with CRUD endpoints (`GET/POST /courses`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /courses/:courseId`).
- Build Enrollment API (`POST /courses/:courseId/enroll`, `GET /courses/:courseId/students`, `GET /users/me/courses`).
- Build Ratings API (`POST/GET /courses/:courseId/ratings`).
- Add validation and error handling for course and enrollment operations.

## 📅 Plan for Tomorrow

- Create course controllers and repository layer for CRUD and enrollment operations.
- Implement ratings endpoints with validation and aggregation logic.
- Add tests for course, enrollment, and ratings endpoints.
- Integrate authentication/authorization middleware for enrollment and rating routes.
