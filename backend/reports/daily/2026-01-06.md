## ✅ Work Done In (2026-01-06)

### Assignment Management API (CRUD) - Complete Implementation

#### Assignment Routes Setup

- Implemented all 5 core assignment routes with middleware chains:
  - `POST /courses/:courseId/assignments` - Create new assignment
  - `GET /courses/:courseId/assignments` - Fetch assignments by course
  - `GET /assignments/:assignmentId` - Retrieve single assignment details
  - `PUT /assignments/:assignmentId` - Update assignment
  - `DELETE /assignments/:assignmentId` - Delete assignment
- Added authentication, rate limiting, and request validation middleware to all routes
- Integrated async error handling middleware for safe execution

#### Assignment Controller Layer

- Implemented 5 controller functions:
  - `createAssignment` - Accept courseId and assignment data, log creation
  - `getAssignmentsByCourse` - Fetch assignments for a specific course
  - `getAssignmentById` - Retrieve assignment details by ID
  - `updateAssignment` - Update assignment with validation
  - `deleteAssignment` - Delete assignment from database
- Added structured logging for all operations
- Implemented consistent response formatting using `successResponse` utility

#### Assignment Service Layer

- Implemented 5 service functions:
  - `createAssignmentService` - Extract courseId and assignment data (title, description, dueDate, maxMarks)
  - `getAssignmentsByCourseService` - Query assignments by course ID
  - `getAssignmentByIdService` - Fetch single assignment by ID
  - `updateAssignmentService` - Update assignment with provided fields
  - `deleteAssignmentService` - Delete assignment by ID
- Services bridge controller and repository layers with data transformation

#### Assignment Repository Layer

- Implemented 5 repository functions using Mongoose:
  - `createAssignment` - Create and save assignment document
  - `getAssignmentsByCourse` - Query assignments filtered by course
  - `getAssignmentById` - Find assignment by ID
  - `updateAssignment` - Update using `findByIdAndUpdate` with validators enabled
  - `deleteAssignment` - Delete using `findByIdAndDelete`
- Database operations use MongoDB queries with proper validation

#### Work Summary

- **Status**: ✅ All assignment CRUD operations completed
- **Architecture**: Follows MVC pattern with service and repository layers
- **Security**: All routes protected with authentication middleware
- **Validation**: Request validation using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Async middleware for safe error propagation
- **Logging**: All operations logged with relevant details
