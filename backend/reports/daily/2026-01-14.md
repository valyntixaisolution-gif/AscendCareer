## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Project Module Implementation** (Complete)

- **Files Created:**
  - `src/validator/project.validator.js` - Zod schemas for create/update validation
  - `src/repositories/project.repository.js` - Database operations with populate
  - `src/services/project.service.js` - Business logic with role-based authorization
  - `src/controllers/project.controller.js` - Request handlers with logging
  - `src/routes/project.route.js` - API endpoints with middleware

- **API Endpoints Implemented:**
  - `POST /courses/:courseId/projects` - Create project (trainer own course, admin)
  - `GET /courses/:courseId/projects` - List projects (enrolled students, trainer own course)
  - `GET /projects/:projectId` - Get project details (enrolled students, trainer own course)
  - `PUT /projects/:projectId` - Update project (trainer own course, admin)
  - `DELETE /projects/:projectId` - Delete project (trainer own course, admin)

- **Security Features:**
  - Role-based access control (student, trainer, admin, super-admin)
  - Course ownership verification for trainers
  - Student enrollment verification
  - Proper error handling with 403 Forbidden responses
  - Comprehensive logging for all operations

### 2. **Internship Module Implementation** (Complete)

- **Files Created:**
  - `src/models/internship.model.js` - Updated with `createdBy` field
  - `src/validator/internship.validator.js` - Zod schemas for create/update
  - `src/repositories/internship.repository.js` - CRUD operations with applicant management
  - `src/services/internship.service.js` - Business logic with role-based auth
  - `src/controllers/internship.controller.js` - 8 controller functions
  - `src/routes/internship.route.js` - Complete API routing

- **API Endpoints Implemented:**
  - `GET /internships` - List all internships (all authenticated)
  - `POST /internships` - Create internship (company, admin)
  - `GET /internships/:internshipId` - Get internship details (all authenticated)
  - `PUT /internships/:internshipId` - Update internship (company own, admin)
  - `DELETE /internships/:internshipId` - Delete internship (company own, admin)
  - `POST /internships/:internshipId/apply` - Apply for internship (student)
  - `DELETE /internships/:internshipId/apply` - Withdraw application (student)
  - `GET /internships/:internshipId/applicants` - List applicants (company own, admin)

- **Security Features:**
  - Company ownership verification
  - Student role enforcement for applications
  - Duplicate application prevention
  - Closed internship validation
  - Applicant withdrawal support
  - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### 3. **Route Registration** (Complete)

- Updated `src/routes/index.route.js` to register:
  - Project router at `/api/v1`
  - Internship router at `/api/v1/internships`

## 📊 Summary

- **Total Files Created:** 11
- **Total Endpoints Implemented:** 13
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Fully implemented for both modules
- **Database Models:** 1 updated (internship model with createdBy)
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging:** All operations logged for audit trail
- **Validation:** Zod schema validation for all inputs

## 🎯 Key Achievements

✅ Implemented complete CRUD operations with role-based authorization  
✅ Enforced ownership verification (trainers for courses, companies for internships)  
✅ Added duplicate prevention for student applications  
✅ Integrated with existing authentication middleware  
✅ Followed project coding patterns and conventions  
✅ All error handling and logging in place
